# Database Cleanup and Professionalization Guide

## Overview

This document explains the comprehensive cleanup performed on the Movie Booking System database and codebase to ensure professional standards and remove inappropriate content.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Inappropriate Field Names
**Problem**: The database contained unprofessional field names that were inappropriate for production use.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced `niganame` with `username` throughout the entire codebase
- Updated all PHP files to use professional naming conventions
- Created migration scripts to safely transition existing data

### 2. Database Structure Improvements
**Problem**: Multiple SQL files with inconsistent schemas and missing relationships.

**Solution**:
- Created a unified `database_schema.sql` with comprehensive structure
- Added proper foreign key constraints
- Implemented professional indexing strategy
- Enhanced table relationships

### 3. Sample Data Cleanup
**Problem**: Inappropriate sample data in the database.

**Solution**:
- Replaced all inappropriate usernames and data
- Created professional sample entries
- Implemented proper admin user creation

Use the migration tool to safely upgrade:

1. Navigate to `http://yoursite.com/migrate.php`
2. The tool will automatically:
   - Create a backup of your current database
   - Update field names from `niganame` to `username`
   - Add new enhanced features
   - Preserve all existing data
